<!-- ![Chatbot Flow Builder](link-to-your-image.png) -->

## Overview

The Chatbot Flow Builder is a web-based application built using React and React Flow library. It allows users to visually design and manage chatbot conversations by arranging nodes and defining connections.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Setup the Project

- Initialize a React project using Create React App or your preferred setup.
- Install React Flow: This library will handle the visual aspect of the flow builder.

### 2. Create the Flow Builder Interface

#### Flow Area
- The main canvas where users can place and connect nodes to design chatbot flows.

#### Nodes Panel
- A sidebar or floating panel with draggable nodes.
- Initially supports message nodes and designed to be extensible for future node types.

### 3. Implementing Nodes

#### Text Node
- Supports multiple text messages, forming the core of the chatbot's conversation flow.

#### Source and Target Handles
- Each node has handles for connecting to other nodes.
- Rules ensure a logical flow: nodes can have multiple incoming edges but only one outgoing edge.

#### Rendering Nodes
- Utilize React Flow to render nodes within the canvas with customizable positions and properties.

### 4. Edges and Connections

#### Edges
- Visual connections between nodes representing the flow of conversation.

#### Validation
- Ensure connections adhere to defined rules:
  - An edge starts from a source handle and ends at a target handle.

### 5. Settings Panel

- When a node is selected, a settings panel displays to edit node properties (e.g., text messages).

#### State Management
- Manage real-time state updates for nodes and edges to reflect changes instantly.

### 6. Save Functionality

#### Save Button
- Allows users to save the current state of the chatbot flow.

#### Validation on Save
- Checks for errors such as disconnected nodes before saving.

#### Persistence
- Implements local storage to persist the chatbot flow across sessions.
